## üîß Technical Implementation

### Button Functionality
```typescript
const handlePrivyLogin = () => {
  loginWithPrivy(); // Triggers Privy modal
};
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Login with Privy" button
2. Privy modal opens with multiple authentication options:
   - Wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
   - Email login with embedded wallet creation
   - Social logins (Google, Twitter, etc.)
3. Upon successful authentication:
   - User is auto-redirected to dashboard
   - Wallet address displayed in header
   - User profile created with investor permissions

### Integration Points
- **Landing Page**: Hero section for maximum visibility
- **Header**: Always accessible for unauthenticated users

## üéØ Availability Summary

Users can now access Privy authentication from:

1. **Landing Page** - Primary hero button (most prominent)
2. **Header** - Available on every page when not logged in

This ensures that no matter where users enter the application, they can easily discover and use Web3 authentication through Privy.

To activate the Privy buttons:
1. Set `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` in your `.env` file
2. Get your App ID from [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io)
